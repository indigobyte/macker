/**
 * A map which allows multiple values per key. This interface is similar to
 * {@link java.util.Map}, but while the entries in an ordinary map have unique
 * keys, the entries in a multi-map are unqiue by key/value pair.
 * <p>
 * The behavior of a multi-map is undefined if its keys are mutable.
 * <p>
 * As with the standard Java collections classes, instances of MultiMap are
 * unsynchronized. See <code>net.innig.collect.InnigCollections</code> for
 * <code>synchronizedMultiMap()</code> and <code>unmodifiableMultiMap()</code> methods.
 * <p>
 * The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections.html">Jakarta
 * Commons Collections</a> package also provides a <a href=
 * "http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/api/org/apache/commons/collections/MultiMap.html"
 * >MultiMap</a>. I like mine a bit better -- instead of extending <a
 * href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Map</a>
 * (which ends up breaking the Map contract), it provides a set of methods more
 * particularly tailored to the behavior of a MultiMap. However, the Jakarta
 * Collections are more widely accepted, and are a generally excellent package,
 * so I certainly recommend checking them out!
